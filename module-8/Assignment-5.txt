Assignment 5: Advanced UI Frameworks (iOS/macOS)

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to work with advanced UI frameworks on iOS or macOS. Students will choose an advanced UI framework such as SwiftUI, Combine, or AppKit (depending on the platform) and create a project that demonstrates the capabilities of the chosen framework.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, you will select an advanced UI framework for either iOS or macOS and create a project that showcases the capabilities of the chosen framework. The assignment will allow you to explore and apply advanced UI concepts and interactions in your iOS or macOS app.

Requirements:

1. Framework Selection:

Choose one of the following advanced UI frameworks based on your target platform:
SwiftUI (for iOS/macOS)
Combine (for iOS)
AppKit (for macOS)
2. Project Idea:

Develop a clear project concept that leverages the capabilities of the selected UI framework. Your project should involve complex UI layouts, data binding, and advanced interactions that demonstrate the strengths of the framework.
3. Implementation:

Build your iOS or macOS app using the selected framework.
Create complex UI layouts that utilize the framework's features and components.
Implement data binding or reactive programming principles if applicable to your chosen framework.
Incorporate advanced interactions, such as gestures, animations, or state management, to enhance the user experience.
4. Testing:

Thoroughly test your app to ensure that the chosen UI framework functions correctly and that advanced interactions work as intended.
5. Documentation:

Provide comprehensive documentation explaining the use of the advanced UI framework within your project.
Include explanations of the complex UI layouts, data binding, and interactions you implemented.
6. Presentation:

Prepare a presentation where you showcase your app and explain how you utilized the advanced UI framework to enhance the user experience.
Submission:

Submit your complete Xcode project folder (for iOS) or Xcode project folder (for macOS) along with any additional assets and resources required for your app. Include your documentation and presentation materials.

Evaluation:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful integration of the chosen advanced UI framework into your iOS or macOS app.
Complexity and creativity of UI layouts and interactions.
Effective use of data binding or reactive programming principles (if applicable).
Thorough testing to ensure the app functions as expected.
Quality and clarity of documentation.
Quality of the presentation and ability to explain the project's use of the advanced UI framework.
