Assignment 2: Properties and Methods in Classes

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce the understanding of properties and methods within classes.

Instructions:

Problem Description:

In this assignment, you will create classes with various properties (both stored and computed) and instance methods. You will implement a set of classes to practice working with properties and methods in Swift.

Requirements:

BankAccount Class:

Create a BankAccount class with the following properties:
accountHolder (String): The name of the account holder.
balance (Double): The current balance in the account.
Implement an initializer to initialize a BankAccount instance with an account holder's name and an initial balance.
Create methods for deposit and withdrawal:
func deposit(amount: Double): This method should add the specified amount to the account balance.
func withdraw(amount: Double): This method should subtract the specified amount from the account balance.
Rectangle Class:

Create a Rectangle class with the following properties:
width (Double): The width of the rectangle.
height (Double): The height of the rectangle.
Implement an initializer to initialize a Rectangle instance with width and height.
Create computed properties to calculate and return the area and perimeter of the rectangle:
var area: Double: Computes and returns the area (width * height).
var perimeter: Double: Computes and returns the perimeter (2 * (width + height)).
Student Class:

Create a Student class with the following properties:
name (String): The name of the student.
scores (an array of Int): An array of test scores.
Implement an initializer to initialize a Student instance with a name and an array of test scores.
Create a computed property called averageScore that calculates and returns the average score of the student.
Create a method called displayInfo() that prints the student's name, scores, and average score.
Submission:
You should submit a Swift file containing the definitions of the BankAccount, Rectangle, and Student classes. Each class should be well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of properties and methods.

Evaluation:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct definition of classes with properties (both stored and computed) and methods
Implementation of initializers and methods
Accurate calculations in computed properties
Code organization and documentation

Additional Notes:

This assignment aims to provide students with hands-on experience in creating classes with properties and methods, which are essential concepts in object-oriented programming with Swift.
Encourage students to create instances of these classes and test their functionality to ensure correctness.
Remind students to use clear and descriptive property and method names to enhance code readability.
Provide examples in your assignment description to illustrate the expected output or behavior of the defined classes and structures.
