Assignment 4: Enumerations and Associated Values

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to explore Swift's enum types and associated values.

Instructions:

Problem Description:

In this assignment, you will work with Swift enumerations (enums) and associated values. You will define a set of enums that represent different geometric shapes, and each enum case will have associated values to store relevant data about those shapes.

Requirements:

Geometric Shapes Enumeration:

Define an enumeration called GeometricShape with the following cases:

circle(radius: Double): This case should have an associated value representing the radius of the circle.
rectangle(width: Double, height: Double): This case should have associated values for both the width and height of the rectangle.
triangle(base: Double, height: Double): This case should have associated values for the base and height of the triangle.
Shape Calculation Method:

Implement a method called calculateArea() for the GeometricShape enum. This method should calculate and return the area of the shape based on its associated values. Use the following formulas:

Circle: Ï€ * radius^2
Rectangle: width * height
Triangle: 0.5 * base * height
Example:

Here's how you should be able to use the GeometricShape enum and its associated values:

swift
Copy code
let circleShape = GeometricShape.circle(radius: 5.0)
let rectangleShape = GeometricShape.rectangle(width: 4.0, height: 6.0)
let triangleShape = GeometricShape.triangle(base: 3.0, height: 4.0)

let circleArea = circleShape.calculateArea() // Should calculate the area of the circle.
let rectangleArea = rectangleShape.calculateArea() // Should calculate the area of the rectangle.
let triangleArea = triangleShape.calculateArea() // Should calculate the area of the triangle.
Submission:
You should submit a Swift file containing the definition of the GeometricShape enum and its associated value cases. Additionally, include the implementation of the calculateArea() method.

Evaluation:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct definition of the GeometricShape enum with associated values.
Implementation of the calculateArea() method that correctly calculates the area based on the shape's associated values.
Code organization and documentation.
Due Date: [Insert due date here]

Additional Notes:

This assignment encourages students to explore Swift's enum types and associated values.
Encourage students to create instances of the GeometricShape enum and calculate the areas to ensure correctness.
Provide examples in your assignment description to illustrate the expected output or behavior of the defined enum and method.
