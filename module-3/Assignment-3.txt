Assignment 3: Methods in Structures

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to practice creating methods within structures.

Instructions:

Problem Description:

In this assignment, you will work with Swift structures and implement methods that operate on the structure's properties. You will define a set of structures and associated methods to solve various problems.

Requirements:

Point Structure:

Create a Point structure with the following properties:
x (Double): The x-coordinate of the point.
y (Double): The y-coordinate of the point.
Implement a method called distance(to otherPoint: Point) -> Double that calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the current point and another point (otherPoint).
The formula for calculating the Euclidean distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is: sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)
Date Structure:

Create a Date structure with the following properties:
year (Int): The year component of the date.
month (Int): The month component of the date.
day (Int): The day component of the date.
Implement methods for adding and subtracting days from a date:
func addingDays(_ days: Int) -> Date: This method should return a new Date instance that represents the date after adding the specified number of days.
func subtractingDays(_ days: Int) -> Date: This method should return a new Date instance that represents the date after subtracting the specified number of days.
Implement validation in these methods to ensure the resulting date remains valid. For example, if the current date is February 28, adding 3 days should result in March 3 (accounting for leap years).
Person Structure:

Create a Person structure with the following properties:
name (String): The name of the person.
age (Int): The age of the person.
Implement a method called sayHello() that prints a friendly greeting message, including the person's name and age.
Submission:
You should submit a Swift file containing the definitions of the Point, Date, and Person structures. Each structure should be well-documented with comments explaining the purpose of properties and methods.

Evaluation:
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct definition of structures with properties
Implementation of methods that correctly operate on structure properties
Accurate calculations in methods
Code organization and documentation

Additional Notes:

This assignment aims to provide students with hands-on experience in creating structures and defining methods within them.
Encourage students to create instances of these structures and test their methods to ensure correctness.
Remind students to use clear and descriptive property and method names to enhance code readability.
Provide examples in your assignment description to illustrate the expected output or behavior of the defined structures and methods.
