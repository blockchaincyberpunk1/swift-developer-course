Assignment 3: Advanced API Integration

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of API integration by working with a more complex API and implementing features like data fetching, parsing, and potentially user authentication.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, you will choose a more complex API, such as a social media feed, cryptocurrency prices, or any other API that requires advanced data manipulation and possibly user authentication. You will build an iOS/macOS app that fetches, parses, and displays data from that API. This assignment will help you further develop your skills in API integration and handling complex data.

Project Requirements:

1. Choose a Complex API:

Select a public API that provides more complex data, which might require advanced data manipulation or authentication. For example, you can choose an API that provides social media posts, cryptocurrency prices, or any other API that interests you.
2. App Concept:

Define the purpose of your app and how it will utilize the chosen API's data. Consider the features you want to implement, such as displaying posts, tracking cryptocurrency prices, or any other relevant functionality.
3. User Interface (UI):

Design a user-friendly interface for your app that accommodates the more complex data. Think about how you'll organize and present this data to users.
4. Networking and Authentication:

Implement the networking code to make HTTP requests to the chosen API. If the API requires user authentication (e.g., OAuth), implement the authentication process as well.
5. API Data Parsing:

Parse the data received from the API, considering that it may be more complex than in previous assignments. Convert the data into Swift data structures suitable for your app's requirements.
6. Data Display and Interaction:

Display the data retrieved from the API in your app's user interface, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive experience. Implement any interactive features based on the data.
7. Error Handling:

Implement robust error handling for network-related issues and authentication errors, if applicable.
8. Testing and User Experience:

Thoroughly test your app to ensure it successfully fetches, parses, and displays data from the API. Focus on providing an excellent user experience.
Submission:

Submit your Xcode project folder (iOS) or Xcode project or Playground (macOS) along with any additional project files, if necessary. Include documentation explaining how to use your app, the purpose of the chosen API, details about the authentication process (if applicable), and any other relevant information.

Evaluation:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of networking code to retrieve data from the chosen API, considering the complexity of the data.
Effective parsing and presentation of API data in the app's user interface.
Proper handling of authentication (if required) and network-related errors.
Thorough testing to ensure the app functions as expected and provides a good user experience.

Additional Notes:

This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of API integration and handling more complex data. Choose an API that genuinely interests you and challenges your skills.
Consider user authentication if the chosen API requires it, as it adds complexity to the assignment and is a valuable skill to learn.
Seek assistance or explore additional resources if you encounter challenges during development. Handling complex APIs and authentication can be challenging, but there are many resources available to help you.
