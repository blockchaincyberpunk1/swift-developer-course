Assignment 2: Advanced Core Data Features

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to explore advanced features of Core Data. Students will extend their Core Data-based app by implementing more advanced features like relationships between entities, fetching data with predicates and sorting, using fetched results controllers, and addressing data migration and versioning.

Instructions:

Task Description:

In this assignment, you will build upon the Core Data knowledge gained in the previous assignment and explore advanced features of Core Data. You will extend your existing Core Data-based app and implement more advanced functionality, including relationships between entities, fetching data with predicates and sorting, using fetched results controllers, and addressing data migration and versioning.

Requirements:

1. Relationships Between Entities:

Extend your existing Core Data model to include relationships between entities. You can create one-to-one or one-to-many relationships between entities based on the requirements of your app.
2. Fetching Data with Predicates:

Implement data fetching using predicates to filter results. For example, you can allow users to search for specific items or filter data based on criteria.
3. Sorting Data:

Implement sorting for fetched data. Users should have the option to sort data by different attributes (e.g., by date, by priority, etc.).
4. Fetched Results Controller:

Implement the use of fetched results controllers (NSFetchedResultsController) to efficiently manage and display data in your app's UI. This is particularly useful for table views and collection views.
5. Data Migration and Versioning:

Address data migration and versioning in Core Data. Make changes to your data model and demonstrate how you handle data migration when users update your app to a new version.
6. Testing:

Thoroughly test your app to ensure that the new features work correctly. Test scenarios involving relationships, predicates, sorting, and data migration.
7. Documentation:

Provide documentation explaining how the advanced Core Data features are used in your app. Document any challenges you encountered and how you addressed them.
Submission:

Submit your updated Xcode project folder (iOS) or Xcode project (macOS) along with any additional project files if necessary. Include documentation explaining how to use the advanced features you've implemented.

Evaluation:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of Core Data relationships between entities.
Accurate data fetching using predicates and sorting.
Effective use of fetched results controllers.
Successful handling of data migration and versioning.
Testing: Is the app thoroughly tested for the advanced features?
Documentation: Is there clear documentation explaining how to use the advanced Core Data features, challenges faced, and solutions implemented?
Due Date: [Insert due date here]

Additional Notes:

Understanding advanced Core Data features is crucial for developing robust and feature-rich iOS/macOS apps.
Use this assignment to enhance your app's functionality and improve your skills in Core Data usage.
Consider the feedback you receive from your instructor and peers during the evaluation.
Document any issues you encountered during the implementation of advanced Core Data features and how you resolved them. This can serve as valuable learning material for future projects.
