Assignment 5: Mini-Project: Simple Calculator App

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to build a basic iOS app that applies Swift fundamentals.

Instructions:

Project Description:
In this mini-project, you will develop a simple calculator app for iOS using Swift. This project will reinforce your understanding of variables, data types, control flow, and user interface development.

Requirements:

User Interface (UI):

Create a user interface with buttons for digits (0-9) and common operations (+, -, *, /).
Include a text area or label to display the current input and results.
Input Handling:

Implement logic to capture user input when buttons are tapped.
Display the entered digits and operations in the text area.
Calculation Logic:

Implement the logic to perform calculations based on the user's input.
Ensure the calculator can handle addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) operations.
Display the calculated result in the text area when the user taps the equals (=) button.
Clear and Reset:

Provide a button (e.g., "C" or "Clear") that allows the user to clear the input and results.
Error Handling:

Handle cases where division by zero might occur or other errors related to calculations.
Optional Enhancements:

Decimal Point: If you want to take it a step further, add a decimal point button to allow decimal numbers in calculations.

Memory Functions: Implement memory functions like "M+", "M-", "MR" (memory plus, memory minus, memory recall).

Submission:
You should submit the Xcode project containing your calculator app. Ensure that your code is well-documented, and your app functions correctly. You can also include a brief document explaining any additional features or enhancements you added.

Evaluation:
Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

User interface design and usability
Accuracy of calculations
Error handling
Code organization and documentation
Optional enhancements (if implemented)
Due Date: [Insert due date here]

Additional Notes:

This mini-project aims to apply Swift programming fundamentals in the context of iOS app development.
You are encouraged to explore iOS development documentation and resources to implement the calculator app effectively.
Test your app thoroughly to ensure it handles different input scenarios and edge cases correctly.
