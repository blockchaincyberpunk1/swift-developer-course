Swift Developer Course

Assignment 1: Basic Syntax Practice

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce students' understanding of Swift's syntax, including variable declaration, constants, and basic operations.

Instructions:

Part 1: Variable Declaration

Variable Declaration: Provide students with a set of variable declaration exercises. For each exercise, instruct them to declare variables with appropriate data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats) and initialize them with specific values. Examples:
Declare an integer variable age and set it to 25.
Declare a string variable name and set it to "John Doe".
Declare a float variable price and set it to 19.99.
Part 2: Constants and Operations

Constants: Introduce students to constants. Instruct them to declare constant variables for values that should not change. For example:

Declare a constant variable pi and set it to the value 3.14159.
Arithmetic Operations: Provide exercises that involve arithmetic operations. Students should perform calculations using variables and constants. For example:

Declare two integer variables, num1 and num2, and set them to different values.
Calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of num1 and num2.
String Manipulation: Assign exercises that require string manipulation, such as concatenation, interpolation, or extracting substrings. For example:

Declare a string variable greeting and set it to "Hello, ".
Declare a string variable name and set it to "Alice".
Combine greeting and name to create a personalized greeting message.
Part 3: Submission and Evaluation

Submission: Students should write Swift code to complete the exercises. They can submit their solutions as code files (e.g., .swift) or in a document.

Evaluation: Assess students' code for correctness, adherence to Swift syntax rules, and the use of appropriate data types. Consider providing feedback on their variable naming conventions and code clarity.

Additional Notes:

Encourage students to write clear and well-documented code, including comments that explain their thought process or any challenges they encountered.
Provide opportunities for students to ask questions or seek clarification on Swift syntax during class or office hours.
