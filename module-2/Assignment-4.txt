Assignment 4: Working with Data Types

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to explore Swift's data types and type inference.

Instructions:

Part 1: Data Type Basics

Integer Operations: Provide students with problems that involve basic integer operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. For example:

Write a Swift program that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.
String Manipulation: Assign exercises that require students to manipulate strings, including concatenation, interpolation, and slicing. For example:

Write a Swift program that reverses a given string.
Boolean Logic: Present problems related to boolean operations and conditions. For example:

Write a Swift program that checks if a given number is even or odd and prints the result.
Part 2: Type Inference

Type Inference in Collections: Introduce type inference in Swift collections, such as arrays and dictionaries. For example:

Write a Swift program that creates an array of mixed data types (e.g., integers, strings) and demonstrates how Swift infers the array's type.
Type Safety and Optionals: Focus on type safety and optionals. Assign problems that involve safely unwrapping optionals and dealing with nil values. For example:

Write a Swift program that safely unwraps an optional and handles the case when it's nil.
Type Conversion: Present challenges that require type conversion between different data types. For example:

Write a Swift program that converts a string representing a number into an integer and performs arithmetic operations.
Part 3: Submission and Evaluation

Submission: Students should write Swift code to solve the assigned problems. They can submit their solutions as code files (e.g., .swift) or in a document.

Evaluation: Assess students' code for correctness, effective use of data types, and adherence to Swift's type inference principles. Provide feedback on code readability and handling of optionals.

Additional Notes:

Encourage students to explore Swift's type inference capabilities and explain how Swift determines variable types.
Promote discussions on the advantages of Swift's type safety and how it helps prevent runtime errors.
Emphasize the importance of handling optionals properly to avoid crashes.
Encourage students to test their code with various inputs to ensure it functions correctly.
