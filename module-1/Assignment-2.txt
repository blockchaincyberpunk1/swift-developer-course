Assignment 2: Control Structures

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to reinforce students' understanding of control structures in Swift, including if statements, loops, and switch statements.

Instructions:

Part 1: Programming Problems

Problem 1 - Conditional Statements:

Instruct students to create a Swift program that evaluates a person's age and determines if they are eligible to vote (age >= 18) or not. The program should print a message accordingly.
Problem 2 - Looping:

Task students with writing a Swift program that uses a for loop to print even numbers from 1 to 20.
Problem 3 - While Loop:

Challenge students to implement a Swift program that uses a while loop to find the sum of the first 50 natural numbers.
Problem 4 - Switch Statements:

Provide a scenario where students need to use a switch statement to handle different user input. For example, they could create a simple calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator as input and prints the result.
Part 2: Testing and Documentation

Testing:

Students should test their solutions with various inputs to ensure they work correctly.
Documentation:

Encourage students to add comments explaining their code, particularly for scenarios where they use control structures. Comments should clarify their logic.
Part 3: Submission

Submission:
Students should submit their Swift source code files for each problem, organized in separate sections or files.
Due Date: [Insert due date here]

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctness: Ensure that students' solutions produce the expected output and handle various input scenarios.
Proper use of control structures: Verify that students have used if statements, loops, and switch statements appropriately for each problem.
Clarity of code: Evaluate the readability and organization of their code.
Testing: Check if students have tested their solutions with different inputs and documented the results.
