Assignment 3: Functions

Objective: The objective of this assignment is to practice defining and calling functions in Swift, including functions with various parameters, return types, and complexities.

Instructions:

Part 1: Programming Problems

Problem 1 - Simple Function:

Instruct students to create a Swift function that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum.
Problem 2 - Function with Return Type:

Task students with writing a Swift function that calculates the factorial of a given integer and returns the result. The function should have an integer parameter.
Problem 3 - Function with Default Parameters:

Challenge students to define a Swift function that calculates the area of a rectangle. The function should have two parameters, length and width, with a default value of 1.0. It should return the area as a floating-point number.
Problem 4 - Recursive Function:

Provide a scenario where students need to create a recursive Swift function to compute the Fibonacci sequence for a given input n.
Part 2: Testing and Documentation

Testing:

Students should test their functions with various inputs to ensure they work correctly.
Documentation:

Encourage students to add comments explaining their functions, including input parameters, return types, and the purpose of each function.
Part 3: Submission

Submission:
Students should submit their Swift source code files for each problem, organized in separate sections or files.

Evaluation Criteria:

Correctness: Ensure that students' functions produce the expected output for different inputs.
Proper use of functions: Verify that students have defined functions with appropriate parameters, return types, and levels of complexity for each problem.
Clarity of code: Evaluate the readability and organization of their code, including function names and comments.
Testing: Check if students have tested their functions with different inputs and documented the results.
